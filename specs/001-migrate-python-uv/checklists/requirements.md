# Specification Quality Checklist: Migrate Python Services to uv Package Manager

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- Amendment 2026-04-06: Added FR-009, SC-006, and acceptance scenarios for legacy file
  removal in US1 and US2, per user instruction that the previous dependency management
  files must be fully removed once the uv migration is confirmed working.
- Note: uv is explicitly named in the spec because it is the specific tool the engineer
  has chosen — this is intentional and appropriate for a tool adoption feature.
